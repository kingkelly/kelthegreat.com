					The<span class="yellow"> science part</span>

					<div class="bullets">
					My compromised kidneys means my body is no longer able to filter the waste in my blood. And because my blood type is B+, the only compatible donors are blood type B or O. This means that the wait-list for a ‘deceased’ kidney could take up to 7+ years. 
					<br><br>
					Clearly, this isn’t an option because we don’t have 7+ years. And so, it means I’m relying on the kindness of a live donor if I’m to get a kidney in time.
					</div>

					What<span class="yellow"> do I need?</span>
					<div class="bullets">
					Most people have two working kidneys but only need one. Which is where you come in. You see, because my blood type is on the rare side, I need a transplant from a live kidney donor. Now that truly would be life-changing. It’s everything I dream of. Because I just want to do more of what I love (see about me section), watch my wife grow older and more beautiful every day and maybe live to see the sun rise on my 75th birthday.
					</div>

					What<span class="yellow"> are the steps</span>
					<div class="bullets">
					<strong>1.</strong> Please discuss with your loved ones and friends if you feel you’re ready. 
					<br><br>

					<strong>2.</strong> You call Rizza, my donor nurse at VGH on 604-875-4111 ext. 22978. She’s great and will be thrilled to hear from you. She’ll ask you some initial questions about your blood type, health and citizenship. 
					 <br><br>
					<strong>3.</strong> There’s a bit more paperwork, followed by a meeting and a test to determine the match. Also, my wife and I would LOVE to meet you. 
					<br><br>
					<strong>4.</strong> After a to-be-determined waiting period, the procedures take place. I bet you have a bunch of questions, but I’ll let the experts answer those. Here’s some <A HREF="https://www.kidney.ca/britishcolumbia/organ-donation-faq" target="_blank">FAQs</A>

					<div class="bullets">
					So, WTF with these kidney things anyway? Well, it’s like this: The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs behind your belly, about the size of a large fist.
					<br><br>
					Their job is to filter your blood, remove the crap, control the body's fluid balance and keep the right levels of electrolytes, whatever the frick they are. Anyways, you got two that work just fine, you lucky S.O.B! Me? Not so lucky. I got two useless piece of shit excuses for a vital organ. 


					</div>

					What<span class="red"> do I need?</span>
					<div class="bullets">
					Ok, so you probably got the skinny by now. If not, here — I’ll spell it out for ya. Pretty please with fricken’ bells on it… can I have one of your kidneys? So I can live some more. And don’t go all sympathy on me — I’m not asking for any of that crap. I just wanna inhale more dim sum, live to see out the next 30 seasons of Peaky Blinders and maybe play some naked twister on my 75th birthday.
					</div>

					What<span class="red"> are the steps</span>
					<div class="bullets">
					<strong>1.</strong> You talk it over with your crew, if you like. Or not. They’ll prolly talk you out of it anyway. 
					<br><br>
					<strong>2.</strong> You call my main girl Rizza at VGH on 604-875-4111 ext. 22978. She’ll ask about your blood type, sanity, health, Canadianness, all that shite.
					<br><br>
					<strong>3.</strong> You fill out a couple of forms. Then the eggheads at the hospital confirm that we’re a good match and we wait for the big day. 
					<br><br>
					<strong>4.</strong> They cut the bastard out of you and shove it into me. You heal up in a coupla weeks, while I get my life back. Capiche? That’s all. If you’re one of those annoying types that need to know everything, then here’s some <A HREF="https://www.kidney.ca/britishcolumbia/organ-donation-faq" target="_blank">FAQs</A>
